    "* **Session 2**. Tutorial on PageRank - Part 2 (60 mins)\n",

    "* **Homework**. Implementation of HITS\n",

    "We recommend fully understanding the lecture videos related to link analysis (or ranking) models such as PageRank, Topic-specific PageRank, and HITS before entering this tutorial since we will not explain the theoretical backgrounds on these techniques during the tutorial. \n",
